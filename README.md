# Python Projects
Physics based programs and side projects built in Python. 
# Table of Contents
1. [Band_Gap_ML.py](https://github.com/Kobregon1/Python_projects/blob/main/Band_Gap_ML.py) - Supervised Machine Learning project that grabs 2D and 3D materials information via CIF (Crystallographic Information File) from the Materials Project database. With this information I extract key features and Band Gap target values in order to perform predictions. Compares against 3 different ML algorithms: Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and XGBoost Regressor.

   Band Gap tells us whether some material is conductive, the main goal of this project that I worked on was to advance to predicting new 2D and 3D material 
   combinations that may be conductive. 

3. [Clock_GUI.py](https://github.com/Kobregon1/Python_projects/blob/main/Clock_GUI.py) - Basic Clock GUI using tkinter, shows date and time in hour, minutes, seconds format.
4. [Ground_State.py](https://github.com/Kobregon1/Python_projects/blob/main/Ground_State.py) - Nuclear based program which uses the ground state harmonic oscillator theory to determine parity.
5. [Q_value_of_decay.py](https://github.com/Kobregon1/Python_projects/blob/main/Q_value_of_decay.py) - Nuclear based program which determines the Q value of decays, and determines whether it is exothermic or endothermic reaction.
